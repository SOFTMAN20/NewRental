# Security Audit Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive security requirements for the Nyumba Link application. The audit focuses on implementing robust security measures to protect against common web vulnerabilities including XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, and other security threats. The goal is to achieve enterprise-level security standards while maintaining application performance and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: XSS Protection Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive XSS protection implemented across all user inputs, so that malicious scripts cannot be executed in users' browsers.

2. WHEN displaying user-generated content THEN the system SHALL escape all HTML entities by default
3. WHEN implementing Content Security Policy THEN the system SHALL restrict script sources to trusted domains only
4. WHEN using inline scripts THEN the system SHALL use nonces or hashes for CSP compliance
5. IF user input contains script tags THEN the system SHALL remove them completely
6. WHEN validating URLs THEN the system SHALL only allow http and https protocols

### Requirement 2: CSRF Token Implementation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want CSRF tokens implemented on all state-changing operations, so that cross-site request forgery attacks are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user session starts THEN the system SHALL generate a unique CSRF token
2. WHEN submitting forms THEN the system SHALL validate CSRF tokens using constant-time comparison
3. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL include CSRF tokens in headers
4. IF CSRF token validation fails THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error
5. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all CSRF tokens
6. WHEN CSRF token expires THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh it

### Requirement 3: CORS Policy Configuration

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want strict CORS policies configured, so that only authorized domains can make cross-origin requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring CORS THEN the system SHALL whitelist only necessary origins
2. WHEN handling preflight requests THEN the system SHALL validate allowed methods and headers
3. IF request origin is not whitelisted THEN the system SHALL reject the request
4. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL disable wildcard CORS origins
5. WHEN handling credentials THEN the system SHALL only allow specific trusted origins

### Requirement 4: SQL Injection Prevention

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all database queries protected against SQL injection, so that unauthorized database access is prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing database queries THEN the system SHALL use parameterized queries exclusively
2. WHEN building dynamic queries THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all inputs
3. IF user input contains SQL keywords THEN the system SHALL escape or reject them
4. WHEN using ORM THEN the system SHALL ensure proper query building practices
5. WHEN logging database errors THEN the system SHALL mask sensitive information

### Requirement 5: Authentication Token Security

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want secure token management with automatic rotation, so that authentication tokens remain secure over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tokens are generated THEN the system SHALL use cryptographically secure random generation
2. WHEN tokens approach expiration THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them
3. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication
4. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate all tokens immediately
5. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL revoke tokens and require re-authentication
6. WHEN storing tokens THEN the system SHALL use secure storage mechanisms only

### Requirement 6: Password Security Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want robust password security measures, so that user accounts are protected against password-based attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users create passwords THEN the system SHALL enforce strong password requirements
2. WHEN checking password strength THEN the system SHALL validate against common password lists
3. IF password is compromised THEN the system SHALL prevent its use and notify the user
4. WHEN storing passwords THEN the system SHALL use bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
5. WHEN user attempts login THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting per user and IP
6. IF multiple failed attempts occur THEN the system SHALL implement progressive delays

### Requirement 7: Rate Limiting Implementation

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive rate limiting across all endpoints, so that abuse and DoS attacks are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing rate limits THEN the system SHALL use sliding window algorithms
2. WHEN rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
3. IF user exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
4. WHEN tracking attempts THEN the system SHALL use both IP and user-based limiting
5. WHEN in production THEN the system SHALL implement different limits for different endpoint types
6. IF suspicious patterns detected THEN the system SHALL implement temporary IP blocking

### Requirement 8: Error Information Masking

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all error messages sanitized in production, so that sensitive system information is not exposed to attackers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in production THEN the system SHALL return generic error messages
2. WHEN logging errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed information securely
3. IF database errors occur THEN the system SHALL mask connection and schema details
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL not reveal whether user exists
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide helpful but non-revealing messages
6. IF system errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide error tracking IDs for support

### Requirement 9: Request Validation Enhancement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive request validation, so that malicious or malformed requests are rejected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving requests THEN the system SHALL validate all input parameters
2. WHEN checking file uploads THEN the system SHALL validate file types and sizes
3. IF request size exceeds limits THEN the system SHALL reject with appropriate error
4. WHEN validating JSON THEN the system SHALL prevent JSON injection attacks
5. WHEN processing uploads THEN the system SHALL scan for malicious content
6. IF request contains suspicious patterns THEN the system SHALL log and potentially block

### Requirement 10: Dependency Security Management

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all dependencies regularly scanned for vulnerabilities, so that known security issues are promptly addressed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding dependencies THEN the system SHALL scan for known vulnerabilities
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL prioritize updates based on severity
3. IF critical vulnerabilities exist THEN the system SHALL require immediate patching
4. WHEN updating dependencies THEN the system SHALL test for breaking changes
5. WHEN scanning completes THEN the system SHALL generate security reports
6. IF automated fixes available THEN the system SHALL apply them after testing

### Requirement 11: Database Security Hardening
